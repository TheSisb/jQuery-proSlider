jQuery-proSlider
================

Turns form input[type=range] into nice sliding UI elements


How to Use
================

1- Insert the plugin JS into your page's JS
2- Add a cool class name to the input type='ranges' you want to transform, like .slider
3- Execute it on a class or id like so:
	$('.slider').proSlider();
4- Customize the CSS and add more classes if needed to your input in the html.  It will automagically be readded to your slider.

Take a look at our base CSS and our added class CSS example in the CSS file.
